P.S. Your trial includes 5 free videos. Most creators use them all on day 1 because they're addicted to the results üòÑ`,

        content: `Hey {{firstName}},

Quick story for you:

Mike was stuck at 1,000 followers for months. Creating content was exhausting - filming, editing, posting... 

Then he discovered Burstlet's "Satisfying Loop" template.

**The result? 100K followers in 30 days.**

Here's exactly what he did:
- Generated 3 videos daily (6 minutes total)
- Used our viral templates exclusively  
- Posted consistently at peak times
- Total cost: $45

Want to see the exact template he used?

I'm sharing this because I want YOU to have the same success. 

The templates are proven. The AI is powerful. All you need to do is press generate.

Talk soon,
Jake

P.S. I noticed you haven't created your first video yet. The average Burstlet user sees results within 48 hours of their first post. Just saying üòâ`,

Most creators burn out because content creation never stops.

But what if you could create a month of content in 10 minutes?

**Here's how Burstlet's bulk generation works:**

1. Choose your templates
2. Set quantity (up to 30)
3. Click "Generate All"
4. Schedule across all platforms
5. Go live your life üèñÔ∏è

Jessica L. uses this every Sunday. She spends 10 minutes creating content for the entire week, then focuses on her business.

Her results? 5M+ views per month on autopilot.

Plus, with our scheduling feature, you can:
- Post at optimal times automatically
- Maintain consistency without effort
- Cross-post to all platforms instantly
- Track everything from one dashboard

The best part? This is included in every plan.

Real talk - your trial ends in 3 days.

I wanted to share what other creators discovered after upgrading:

"I was skeptical about paying $29/month. Now I make $3K/month from brand deals thanks to my Burstlet-grown audience." - Emma K.

"The ROI is insane. I spend $29, create content that would cost $5,000 with editors." - David R.

"My videos get 10x more views with Burstlet templates. It pays for itself with one viral video." - Lisa T.

**Your stats so far:**

Quick story about someone just like you:

Marcus quit creating content for 3 months. Burned out. Frustrated. Sound familiar?

Then he came back to Burstlet with a new approach:
- 1 video per day
- Only used templates
- No overthinking

Result? 1M followers in 60 days.

His secret: He stopped trying to be perfect and let the templates do the work.

Your comeback could be even bigger.
