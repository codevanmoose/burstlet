# CLAUDE.md - Burstlet Development Guide

This document serves as the primary reference for AI assistants working on the Burstlet project. It contains essential context, architectural decisions, and development patterns that should guide all contributions.

## Project Overview

## Important Notes
- Follow Van Moose principle: files must be under 500 lines
- Each module must have comprehensive tests
- All APIs must be agent-ready with semantic documentation
- Security-first approach with rate limiting and encryption
- Visual regression tests must pass before merging to main
- Run `npm run test:visual` to verify UI changes
- Use `npm run test:visual:update` to update baselines when intentional changes are made

## Billing Page Requirements (Next Session)

1. **Stripe Products & Prices** - Create in Stripe Dashboard:
   - Starter Plan: $29/month (100 video generations, 500 blog posts)

   - Enterprise Plan: $299/month (unlimited everything, dedicated support)

2. **Stripe Webhooks** - Configure endpoints for:
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`

3. **UI Components Needed**:
