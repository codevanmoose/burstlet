## 🚨 CRITICAL BACKEND NOTE
**The backend is currently running a minimal HTTP server (src/minimal-server.js) without Express or any npm dependencies due to DigitalOcean deployment constraints. This was necessary because DigitalOcean was removing node_modules after build. Future migration to full Express server will be needed once we resolve the dependency management issue.**
