# Burstlet MVP Status Report

**Date**: 2025-07-19  
**Current State**: Frontend Live, Backend Partially Deployed

## ✅ What's Working

### Infrastructure
- **Domain**: burstlet.com (with SSL) ✅
- **Frontend**: Fully deployed on Vercel ✅
- **Backend**: Deployed on DigitalOcean (minimal mode) ✅
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL configured ✅
- **Redis**: Redis Cloud configured ✅
- **Environment Variables**: All critical keys loaded ✅

### API Keys Configured
- ✅ OpenAI (blog generation)
- ✅ HailuoAI (video generation)
- ✅ MiniMax (audio generation)
- ✅ Stripe (payments)
- ✅ Resend (emails)
- ⚠️ Social OAuth (not configured yet)

### Current Features
- Basic health check endpoints
- Test authentication endpoints (register/login)
- CORS configured for frontend
- Environment variable verification

## ❌ What's Not Working

### Critical Issues
1. **Express Dependencies**: DigitalOcean removes node_modules after build
2. **Database Not Connected**: Prisma client can't initialize without Express
3. **No Real Authentication**: Currently returns test tokens
4. **No Content Generation**: AI modules not deployed
5. **No Payment Processing**: Stripe integration not active

### Missing Features
- Real user registration/login with JWT
- Video generation with HailuoAI
- Blog generation with OpenAI
- Content management system
- Analytics dashboard
- Billing/subscription management
- Social media posting

## 🔧 What We Need to Do

### Option 1: Fix DigitalOcean Deployment
- Bundle dependencies differently
- Use Docker container
- Switch to different build process
- Pre-compile everything

### Option 2: Switch Hosting Provider
- **Railway**: Better Node.js support
- **Render**: Good for Express apps
- **Fly.io**: More control over deployment
- **AWS/GCP**: Full control but complex

### Option 3: Serverless Approach
- Deploy API routes to Vercel
- Use Vercel Functions
- Keep everything in one place
- Simpler deployment

## 📊 Current Architecture

```
Frontend (Vercel) ✅
    ↓
Backend API (DigitalOcean) ⚠️
    ↓
Database (Supabase) ✅
    ↓
Storage (Supabase) ❌
    ↓
Queue (Redis) ✅
```

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. **Decision**: Choose deployment strategy
2. **If staying with DigitalOcean**: 
   - Try building with webpack
   - Bundle all dependencies
   - Create single output file
3. **If switching platforms**:
   - Set up new hosting
   - Migrate environment variables
   - Update DNS

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Deploy full Express backend
2. Run database migrations
3. Test real authentication
4. Enable one AI feature (blog or video)
5. Basic content management

### Medium Term (Next Week)
1. Complete all AI integrations
2. Enable payment processing
3. Add social media OAuth
4. Polish UI/UX
5. Beta testing

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Current Monthly Costs
- Vercel: Free tier ✅
- DigitalOcean: $5/month
- Supabase: Free tier
- Redis Cloud: Free tier
- Domain: ~$12/year

### Projected Costs (with users)
- AI APIs: Usage-based (~$0.05 per generation)
- Stripe: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- Email: Free up to 3,000/month
- Hosting: May need to upgrade

## 🚀 Success Metrics

### Technical
- [ ] Full backend deployment
- [ ] Database migrations complete
- [ ] All APIs integrated
- [ ] Payment processing working
- [ ] <3s page load times

### Business
- [ ] First user registration
- [ ] First paid subscription
- [ ] First AI generation
- [ ] First social media post
- [ ] 100% uptime for 7 days

## 📝 Summary

**The Good**: Frontend is polished and ready. All API keys configured. Infrastructure in place.

**The Challenge**: DigitalOcean deployment issues preventing full backend from running.

**The Path Forward**: Either fix the deployment bundling or switch to a more Node.js-friendly platform.

**Time Estimate**: 1-2 days to fully operational MVP with chosen solution.
